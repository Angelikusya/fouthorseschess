- Develop an adaptive landing page based on the Figma design, using the stack of HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript (without libraries and frameworks). 
- Follow to the Pixel Perfect principle.
-  Avoid duplicating textual content between the mobile and desktop versions. 
- Implement a marquee text and other animations at your discretion
- The buttons on the home screen should act as anchors leading to the corresponding sections. 
- The participant cards carousel should be looped and automatically switch every 4 seconds. 
- The stages carousel should not be looped and should not automatically change slides.

#### My comments.
- Total time: 1 week.
- Second marquee text is done with duplicsting text for more pretty view.
